## Igniting our App

### Episode 2 - Part 1: Igniting our App

For pushing our code into production we need to : -
Bundling
Chunking
Code splitting
Image optimisation

Production ready app. when we do npx create-react-app it gives you a production ready codes which are already setup for us but here we are going to build it from scratch.
There are lot of other things alongwith react which makes our application fast and production ready.
npm - is not node package manager .Its a package manager for JS.And has all the packages.

Make our project use npm ?
npm init
package.json is configuration for npm.It will manage all package/dependncies.Our dependent on a lot of package .npm will take care of the version of the package.
We are going to install package , the most important package in our project is a bundler.Our whole code needs to be bundled,complessed,cleaned , cached ,minified before sending it to the production.

- webpack
- parcel
- vit

npx-create-react-app uses webpack , babel to bundle our code behind the scenes.

npm install parcel

- There are two types of dependencies

1.  dev dependencies (used while development) -D
2.  normal dependencies (used in production also)

"parcel": "^2.9.3" -- > ^ update minor version update or parcel (recommended to use ^ , ~ major version update )

What is package.json and package-lock.json ?
package-lock.json keeps the record of every version . Exact version of dependency.The package.json can have ~ or ^ .package-lock.json have approx version.

node-modules - npm init .fetching all code of parcel and putting it inside node modules.
We only installed parcel but more folders got into . Because parcel may have few dependencies which has its own dependencies and this is known as transitive dependencies due to which so many folders got inside the node modules.
Every dependency has its own package.json and it has its own dependencies.

node_modules not go into production / git
.gitignore
/node_modules

Push into git - package.json and package-lock.json
if you have package.json and package-lock.json with you then we can regenerate node_modules. (npm i)

### Episode 2 - Part 2: Igniting our App

We will use parcel to ignite our app

Command :- npx parcel index.html
Output :-
Server running at http://localhost:1234
âœ¨ Built in 592ms

Parcel has created a server for us and hosting it in port 1234.
npx parcel index.html (npx similar to npm , executing a package -npx,)

Another was to get react is npm . CDN method are not preferred way ,why ?

1. Not make network call to get react but have it in our node_modules.
2. src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" what if the version changes?it will be easy to maintain inside node_modules.

npm i react
npm i react-dom

Erro -

 <script src="./App.js"></script>

Our application is treating App.js file as normal js and hence normal js file cannot have imports.

 <script src="./App.js" type="module"></script>

Parcel did

- Dev Build
- Local Server
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement
- File Watching Algorithm - Written in C++
- Caching - Faster Builds
- Image optimisation
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compressing
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting
- Differencial Bundling - (app runs(supports) in older browsers as well.parcel does that for us.Different bundle for different browsers )
- Diagnostics
- Better Error suggestions.
- HTTPs ,gives way to host in HTTPS
- Tree Shaking - remove unused code .
- Different build for Dev and Production.

Why it is fast - because it has .parcel-cache

npx parcel build index.html -for build (Remove the "main": "App.js", in package json because conflicts may come.)
dist - when execute parcel, generate a development build and puts it in dist folder and refresh , it used parcel_cache and dist to update it using hmr.

npx parcel build index.html - takes more time .It will give you 1 html , 1 CSS , 1 JS file.These three files are you production ready code for your app.Highly optimised build.

.parcel-cache and dist can be regenerated . Any thing which can be regenerated need to be pushed into github
in server these files are regenerated.

browserslist
npm package
browserslist:["last 2 versions"]
